# Flame
HackED project 
This project is designed to find a fire and shoot water at alone using a sensor. It is a smart fire sprinkler that utilizes an  Arduino UNO R3 as our microcontroller of choice. An IR flame sensor is used to detect if there is water, 2 servos were used to move the sprinkler in the direction of the fire, and a pump attached to a relay is used to shoot out the water onto the fire at any location within its vicinity. 

code is attached to communicate with arduino.
